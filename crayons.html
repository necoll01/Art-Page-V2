    Crayons. When most people think of them, they think coloring. But it turns 
    out that an artists crayon packs a little bit more punch than the ones that you used in 
    kindergarten. Most artist know them as pastels- and they look similar to the crayons we all knew as a kid. 
    In fact- some call them adult crayons.

</p>

<h2>Variations</h2>

<p>There are generally two types of pastels- oil pastels and chalk pastels. Oil pastels are waxy like a traditional crayon but a lot
    more blendable, while chalk pastels are smoother than a sidewalk chalk and brighter. They make a third variation which gets a bit 
    less attention- they are called water soluble pastels. All that the word soluble means is that they are able to be manipulated by water.
</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>If you think that oil pastels sound more interesting than chalk- I would probably start with the following tools: </p>
<ul>
    <li>A beginners oil pastel set</li>
    <li>A blending stump</li>
    <li>Something to scrape away excess oil pastel with, I would recommend a paper clip</li>
    <li>Textured paper, preferably something thick due to the oil that comes from the pastels. A pastel paper should do the trick,
        if you can find it.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you think that chalk pastels (also called soft pastels) sound more interesting- start with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A beginners chalk pastel kit</li>
    <li>Pastel paper</li>
</ul>

<p>One final note: I would not recommend using any kind of pastel or chalk as a beginner medium for a child because of the level 
    of mess and staining that they can do.
