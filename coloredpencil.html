    <h1>Colored Pencils</h1>
</header>
    <p>Much like the pencil, or the pen, most people are already somewhat familiar with the colored pencil. It's a popular choice for a good reason: colored pencils are portable, non-toxic, and super colorful. Despite the fact that they aren't traditionally
        erasable like the pencil, colored pencils are still a very versatile tool for making art. When talking about colored pencils it is important to mention that there are 
        multiple types. The main two that you will run into at your local craft store
        are going to be the traditional colored pencil, and the watercolor pencil. The difference between the two is how they react to water. 
        Watercolor pencils as you might guess, can be manipulated with water.

    <h2>Choosing the Right Colored Pencils</h2>
    <p>The first thing that tell everyone I can about colored pencils is not to put them into a mechanical sharpener. The lead in colored pencils 
        is much softer than that of a traditional pencil. Putting your colored pencils in an electric sharpener can result in damage to your supplies. 
        After that, the next thing to decide is what level of quality you want out of your colored pencils. There are your classic low-end brands such as Crayola,
        or more high-end brands like Prismacolor. I would definitely reccomend going with a lower-end brand while you are learning. 
        <h3>Things to Look For in a Colored Pencil:</h3>
        You definitely are going to want to pay close attention to the colors when you go to pick out your new set. It is important to make sure that it has the colors you need for whatever 
        you plan to draw. If there aren't enough colors in the set that you've chosen, you may be able to blend two colors together to get your desired outcome. (for example, layering red 
        and blue to get purple) It may also be helpful to check online reviews to see what the quality of blending is, since the box usually won't tell you.
    </p>

    <p>No matter what kind of colored pencils you end up using, you will want to make sure that you take your time and don't be too hard on yourself. It is common practice to 
        sketch out what you want before using colored pencils since they aren't erasable. But most importantly, have fun!
