    <h1>Colored Pencils</h1>
    <p>Much like the pencil, or the pen, most people are already somewhat familiar with the colored pencil. It's a popular choice for a good reason: colored pencils are portable, non-toxic, and super colorful. Despite the fact that they aren't traditionally
        erasable like the pencil, colored pencils are still a very versatile tool for making art. When talking about colored pencils it is important to mention that there are multiple types. The main two that you will run into at your local craft store
        are going to be the traditional colored pencil, and the watercolor pencil. The difference between the two is how they react to water. Watercolor pencils as you might guess, can be manipulated with water.
