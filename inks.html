        <h1>INKS</h1>
    </header>
<p>When most people think of ink, they think of ink pens. But the ink pen has a much
    more fluid cousin: India ink. India ink is a bottled ink commonly found in craft
    and office supply stores (due to the fact that you can refill some types of pen with it).
    India ink is water soluble when wet and waterproof when dry, making it a great companion
    for watercolor. India ink is commonly used by artists due to the fact that you can 
    layer it without the colors bleeding into each other.
</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>
    The main tool you will need is a bottle of India ink. One of the more popular brands you will
    see in store is <a href="https://www.docmartins.com/collections/bombay-india-ink">Dr. Ph Martin's India Ink.</a>
     These inks come in multiple colors which makes them great for making all kinds of art.
    If you are just looking to buy one or two colors of India ink, I'd start with black, and an 
    accent color. 
</p>
<p> There are a variety of different tools that you can use to manipulate inks. You can dip a 
    stick from your yard into the ink, you can buy a water brush (which is a paintbrush with storage
    for water in the handle), a fountain pen (make sure you use the right kind), a paint brush,
    and a nib pen.
</p>
<p>If you'd like more information on selecting a paint brush that would be suitable for inks,
    try visiting the <a href="watercolor.html">watercolor page</a>!
</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>With all of your tools in hand, you now need something to use your brand new inks on! 
    Due to the watery nature of ink, I would start with a watercolor paper, as it's thick 
    enough to not roll up when you apply water. Other options are canvas, cardboard, and fabric. 
    <br>Fun Fact: Tattoo artists actually use black India ink as the black ink for tattoos. (But 
    please don't tattoo yourself!)
