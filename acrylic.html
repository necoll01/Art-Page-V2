        <h2>Brushes</h2>
        In painting (no matter what kind you do) there is a variety of different brush types and shapes, so it can be
        easy to get overwhelmed. When you are first starting out, they should sell some pretty cheap brushes at your
        local craft store. The key to getting
        an decent brush without breaking the bank is to buy the second cheapest one. This method isn't 100% fool-proof
        but it works for me most of the time. Buying nice twenty dollar a pop brushes is nice, and they will last a
        lifetime if you take care of
        them, but it just doesn't make sense if you're not sure that you want to commit to painting quite yet.

        <h2>Paints</h2>
        <p>There are a ton of different options when you go looking for acrylic paints. The two main types are student
            grade and artist grade (sometimes called professional grade).
            The biggest difference you will notice between the two is price. Professional grade is going to be
            considerably more expensive, but it comes with a higher quality and often
            more pigmented paint (which means you will spend less time getting your art "just right"). You may sacrifice
            some quality if you go the student grade route, but they still get
            the job done. Which means your heart will hurt a little less when you end up wasting paint.
        </p>

        <p>Once you've gone to the store and found the student grade (or artists grade) paints, you will likely be faced
            with the next daunting question: Which color should I get?
            Luckily this one is an easy question to answer. When you first start off you should only need five colors.
            Black and white (to lighten and darken colors) and the three primary colors
            which are red, blue and yellow. You may notice there are different shades of the primary colors. I would
            stick with the following shades, as they are the ones I see used often:
            <div class="colorgrid">
     
                
                <div class="titanium-white">Titanium White</div>
                <div class="cadmium-yellow">
                    Cadmium Yellow
                </div>
                
                    <div class="ultramarine">
                    Ultramarine Blue
                </div>
                <div class="alizarin">
                    Alizarin Crimson
                </div>
           
                <div class="raw-umber">
                Raw Umber
            </div>
            <div class="phthalo">
                Phthalo Blue
            </div>
            <div class="paynes-grey">Payne's Grey</div>
            <div class="black">
                    Black
                </div>
            </div>
        </p>
<p> If there is a color you find yourself mixing frequently,
    it may be beneficial for you to buy a bottle of it. For example,
    I once did a series of flower paintings, so I bought a tube of pink.
    I haven't included speciality paints in this (like metallic paints for example)
    but you can buy those at your own descretion. I personally like adding gold to some of my work,
    and it is impossible to mix a metallic shade with non-metallic paint.
