    <h2>Brushes</h2>
    In painting (no matter what kind you do) there is a variety of different brush types and shapes, so it can be easy to get overwhelmed. When you are first starting out, they should sell some pretty cheap brushes at your local craft store. The key to getting
    an decent brush without breaking the bank is to buy the second cheapest one. This method isn't 100% fool-proof but it works for me most of the time. Buying nice twenty dollar a pop brushes is nice, and they will last a lifetime if you take care of
    them, but it just doesn't make sense if you're not sure that you want to commit to painting quite yet.
