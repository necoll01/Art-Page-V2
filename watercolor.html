    Watercolors are exactly what they sound like: colorful water. The more technical explanation is that watercolors are pigment suspended in a water-based solution. They can be very delicate looking, if you know how to control them. Most of the time unfortunately,
    water likes to kind of do it's own thing. This makes finding the right pigment-to-water ratio kind of a pain. But with the right amount of practice, you can make some beautiful art. Getting Started The cheapest way to start painting with watercolors
    is to find the craft aisle at your local department store and buy a set of <a href="">Crayola Watercolors</a>. This will usually run you less than five dollars, and best of all is it comes with a brush, AND it's washable! I will admit, I'm not
    a huge fan of the Crayola brush it comes with, for 
    two reasons: it's a pretty cheap brush (the shedding of the hairs
     can lead to you picking bristles out of your artwork), and it only comes with a 
     round brush.

    <h2>Brushes</h2>
    In painting (no matter what kind you do) there is a variety of different brush types and shapes, so it can be easy to get overwhelmed. When you are first starting out, they should sell some pretty cheap brushes at your local craft store. The key to getting
    an decent brush without breaking the bank is to buy the second cheapest one. This method isn't 100% fool-proof but it works for me most of the time. Buying nice twenty dollar a pop brushes is nice, and they will last a lifetime if you take care of
    them, but it just doesn't make sense if you're not sure that you want to commit to painting quite yet.
