        <p>Hi, my name is Natalie Collins and I've been an artist for as long as I can remember.
            I always wished for a website where I had all of the resources I needed to learn more about art at no cost
            to me. Now that I've collected
            most of the knowledge I wanted over the years from various places, I figured what better way to give back to
            the art community than to provide
            that site I always wished I could have handy for all of you. No matter your skill level or interest, I hope
            that art can open doors for you the way it has for me.
        </p>
        <p>-Natalie</p>


        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest pieces of wisdom that was departed upon me was to keep it simple. The best way to start
            learning how to create any form of art is to start
            drawing. A practice drawing is called a sketch, which helps you plan for a more complete and complex version
            of the art you create. All you need to
            do this is a writing utensil and some paper. This leads me to introduce our first tool you can use to create
            art: the pencil!

        <p>Pencils are one of the most widely known tools for artists. They use a stick of graphite in a piece of wood
            to mark on paper and create drawings.
            The best part about a pencil is that mistakes can be erased!
