            <p> My name is Natalie Collins and I've been an artist for as long as I can remember. I always wished for a website where I had all of the resources I needed to learn more about art at no cost to me.

                matter your skill level or interest, I hope that art can open doors for you the way it has for me.

                complex version of the art you create. All you need to do this is a writing utensil and some paper.
                <br>This leads me to introduce our first tool you can use to create art:

                <p>
                    Pencils are one of the most widely known tools for artists. The best part about a pencil is that mistakes can be erased!
