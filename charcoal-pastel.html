    <img src="../Art-Page-V2/images/mycharcoal.jpg" alt="charcoal portrait"> Charcoals and pastels are two different mediums, but have some things in common, so I decided that they should be grouped together. They are both considered dry mediums, which
    usually come in the format of a stick. This makes them very portable, but this also comes with a small downfall: they can get messy!

    <h3>Pastels:</h3>

    <p>
        Pastels are similar to crayons in the sense that they are both traditionally pretty waxy. Pastels are a lot easier to blend though. A lot of artist (including myself) just use a finger to blend the colors together.
