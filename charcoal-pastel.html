    Charcoals are very portable, but this also comes with a small downfall: they can get messy!

    <h2>Choosing The Right Tools: </h2>
    <h3>Charcoal Pencils VS Charcoal Sticks</h3>
    <p>You will find out quickly after visiting your local craft store that there are two general types of charcoal to choose from: <br>
        Pencils and Sticks.
        <br>
        Pencils allow you to have a nice and sharp edge to use when drawing, allowing for more precise lines and less mess all over your hands. If you go this route,
        you will probably have to carry a pencil sharpener with you for when things get dull. 
        The sticks allow for a greater variations of strokes and don't require all of that pesky sharpening. They are considerably more messy, but you generally will 
        get results quicker going this route.
