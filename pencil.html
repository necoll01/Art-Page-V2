                The great thing about using pencils is that most people already know the basics on how they work, but assuming you dont:
            </p>

            <p>Historically a pencil is usually a piece of graphite enclosed in a long thin piece of wood which is fixed into a plastic or metal case. Sometimes there is an eraser on the end, which removes the graphite marks from the marked surface. Erasers
                are usually made of rubber. The standard type is a number two pencil.
            </p>

            <h2>HB Grading Scale</h2>

            <p>I briefly mentioned that the most common type of pencil is a number two pencil. Have you ever wondered where that number even comes from?
            </p>
            <img src="../Art-Page-V2/images/PencilGradingChart.png" alt="Pencil Grading Chart">
            <p>When pencils are made they choose a piece of graphite to put into the wood casing of a pencil. This graphite comes in different grades of hardness which affects the way that the pencil marks on the paper. Most of the pencil marks in the picture
                above either have an H or B next to them, which would be indicated on the outside of the pencil. The pencils that start with H stand for "Hard" are going to have a thinner lead which will smudge less and make a lighter colored line. This
                is nice for sketching, when you want to be able to erase the lines easily. The higher the number next to the H the harder the lead is going to be.The B on the side of the pencil is going to stand for bold and the higher the number the
                softer the lead and the darker the mark the lead will make. There are exceptions to this rule of course, which would be pencils with letters like F or HB. F stands for fine point and HB is in the middle of the HB scale.

            </p>

            <h2>Sketching</h2>
            <p>

                Once you've figured out what kind of pencil to use, it is important for you to learn how to sketch. Sketching is kind of like a rough draft. I reccomend using a sketchbook for this purpose. It's a great way to collect all of your thoughts and art in one
                place. Once you have all of your supplies gathered, you can start to draw! Let's say for example you wanted to draw a cup, there are actually two ways to go about that!</p>

            <h2>Drawing From Life VS Drawing From Your Mind</h2>
            <p>Drawing from life is suprisingly much more difficult than drawing from a thought that you've had in your head. Let's go back to that cup scenario: if you are drawing from what pops in your head of a cup, there is generally more room for error
                than if you were to draw a cup sitting right in front of you. A drawing that you would create from looking at real objects is called a still life. Still lifes require a thing called perspective- which is the way things sit according to
                its surroundings. Let me show you an example:
            </p>

            <div class="resources">
                <p>
                    Perspective is one of the hardest things to grasp when you are first starting out. Luckily, there are actually some artist who distort perspective as a part of their art, like this piece called <a href="https://www.pablopicasso.org/portrait-of-sabartes.jsp">
                        Portrait of Sabartes by Pablo Picasso.</a> But the most important thing to remember when you are drawing is that we are always learning, so try not to be too hard on yourself. If you stare at a piece you are working on too long,
                    it will be harder to keep things looking the way you want them to. I always reccomend that any artist step back five feet before making a big decision on a piece of art. Often times when I do this, it helps me maintain perspective
                    and other aspects of my art that I had in my head when I started. If you want a more in depth look at perspective- check the Learning Resources portion at the bottom of this page.

                <h2>Resources for Drawing:</h2>
                <p>As a general guide, <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> is always a great place to start. There are plenty of free videos out there to "get your feet wet" without you having to show up and pay for an actual art class. (Which is
                    great for a busy schedule, and your wallet!) Here are resources on all of the topics that I mentioned above.

                        <dd>This video has a great basic overview of sketching and a great list of materials that most pencil artists will use (besides the obvious pen and paper). It's also important to note that this is part of a series, which goes more
                            into depth about drawing.

                        <dd>This video covers basic principles of perspective- going over one point, two point, and three point perspective. This is a very basic tutorial, and there are more videos like this out there for different types of perspective drawing
                            (for example, if you were going to draw people, or maybe cars.)

                    <p>As one last piece of food for thought before you go, remember that just because someone else uses one technique to create art, doesn't necessarily mean that it will work for you. It's all about finding ways to create that are easiest
                        for you!
