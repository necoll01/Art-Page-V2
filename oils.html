        <header><h1>Oil Painting</h1></header>
        <p>
    When most people think of oil painting, usually an older painting comes to mind, like the Mona Lisa. Oils have been a popular choice for centuries for a good reason: the slow drying time allows room for error and plenty of time to add in tiny details.
    This can also be a downside if you are looking to do quick layers and want to have a finished and dry piece the same day. Fumes are also a big thing to take into consideration with oil paints. Unlike acrylics and watercolors where most companies are
    producing non-toxic formulas- oils require mostly toxic additives
     such as turpentine and linseed oil- which can help thin the paint.<br> There are also other additives for oil paint that can help thicken, thin or add textures. This creates some added
    cost to your paintings but the amount of control that oil painting 
    gives an artist has made it a long time favorite for the art community. Generally I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point just because there are so many things that could go
    wrong in oil painting, but if you do your homework 
    or have some previous experience with painting, you should do fine.</p>

        <h2>Brushes</h2>
    <p>
        When selecting paint brushes for oil painting things can get confusing pretty quickly. You would think with all of the harsh chemicals that go into oil painting, that you 
        might need a specialized brush. But suprisingly- that's not the case. Synthetic brushes (those that aren't made of real hair) are actually less susceptible to damage
        from turpentine. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In painting (no matter what kind you do) there is a variety 
        of different brush types and shapes, so it can be easy to get 
        overwhelmed. When you are first starting out, they should sell 
        some pretty cheap brushes at your local craft store. The key to 
        getting an decent brush without breaking the bank is to buy the 
        second cheapest one. This method isn't 100% fool-proof but it 
        works for me most of the time. Buying nice twenty dollar a pop 
        brushes is nice, and they will last a lifetime if you take care 
        of them, but it just doesn't make sense if 
        you're not sure that you want to commit to painting quite yet.

<h2>Paints</h2>

<p>
      There are definitely a lot of choices when you go to buy any kind of paint. Luckily, I'm here to break it down!      
    The two main types are student
    grade and artist grade (sometimes called professional grade).
    The biggest difference you will notice between the two is price. Professional grade is going to be
    considerably more expensive, but it comes with a higher quality and often
    more pigmented paint (which means you will spend less time getting your art "just right"). You may sacrifice
    some quality if you go the student grade route, but they still get
    the job done.</p>

    <p>When we talk more specifically about oil paints, it isn't so much the actual paint you need to really take a good long
        hard look at as much as it is the solvents you use with them. Some popular solvents include linseed oil, galkyd, and gamsol. 
        If you're looking for more information on the ratios and context in which these should be used (I could write pages on it)
        you should check the "Basics of Oil Painting" video I linked in the resources section.


    </p>
<p>Once you've gone to the store and found the student grade (or artists grade) paints, you will likely be faced
    with the next daunting question: Which color should I get?
    Luckily this one is an easy question to answer. When you first start off you should only need five colors.
    Black and white (to lighten and darken colors) and the three primary colors
    which are red, blue and yellow. You may notice there are different shades of the primary colors. I would
    stick with the following shades, as they are the ones I see used often:</p>
