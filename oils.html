    When most people think of oil painting, usually an older painting comes to mind, like the Mona Lisa. Oils have been a popular choice for centuries for a good reason: the slow drying time allows room for error and plenty of time to add in tiny details.
    This can also be a downside if you are looking to do quick layers and want to have a finished and dry piece the same day. Fumes are also a big thing to take into consideration with oil paints. Unlike acrylics and watercolors where most companies are
    producing non-toxic formulas- oils require mostly toxic additives such as turpentine and linseed oil- which can help thin the paint. There are also other additives for oil paint that can help thicken, thin or add textures. This creates some added
    cost to your paintings but the amount of control that oil painting gives an artist has made it a long time favorite for the art community. Generally I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point just because there are so many things that could go
    wrong in oil painting, but if you do your homework or have some previous experience with painting, you should do fine.

        When selecting paint brushes for oil painting things can get confusing pretty quickly. You would think with all of the harsh chemicals that go into oil painting, that you 
        might need a specialized brush. But suprisingly- that's not the case. Synthetic brushes (those that aren't made of real hair) are actually less susceptible to damage
        from turpentine.
